 * not, and the market-specific calibration would then be measured on a

 * matrix marginals, the `secondary` market block, the per-market evaluation
 * records and the checkpoint payload. Any change to what a completed walk
 * EMITS bumps this number and forces one full historical rebuild.
 *
 *   v1 — original pipeline.
 *   v2 — 20-dimensional feature vector, HT features, momentum, joint matrix,
 *        session checkpoint.
 *   v3 — RELEASE A: team-goal markets (`homeOver05` / `homeUnder05` /
 *        `awayOver05` / `awayUnder05`) on every `MatchPipeline.secondary`.
 *   v4 — RELEASE C: market-specific prequential calibration
 *        (`MARKET_EVAL_SPECS`, `MarketCalibrationBand`) accumulated during the
 *        walk and persisted on the checkpoint.
 *
 * Release A and Release C each require their own full rebuild. They ship in the
 * same build here, so the stamp lands on v4 directly: every checkpoint written
 * before this build (v1/v2, or unstamped) is discarded once and rebuilt from
