 * measured on the Audit screen is by construction the accuracy of the model
 * that produces these tips. The only difference between the two call sites is
 * the history slice: the audit passes strictly-prior matches, this passes
 * everything currently known.
 *
 * PHASE 0 FOLLOW-UP (closed): `forecastCore`'s Stage 2 baseline supports an
 * optional Dixon-Coles low-score correction (`dixonColesRho`), consumed by
 * {@link computeJointScoreDistribution}. Until now this predictor never
 * forwarded it, so whenever the experiment branch tuned and enabled a
 * validated rho on the audit side, the forward-looking tip silently kept
 * using the independent-Poisson grid (`rho = 0`) — the exact audit/prediction
 * split PHASE 0 was written to eliminate, just reopened one parameter later.
 *
 * `dixonColesRho` is therefore now a first-class, pass-through parameter here,
 * mirroring `m1Fit` and `ensembleWM1`: the caller decides whether a validated
 * value exists (see `utils/experiments/dixonColes.ts`), this function's only
 * job is to make sure that decision reaches `forecastCore` unchanged.
 *
 * CONSEQUENCE OF OMISSION — read this before calling without `m1Fit`:
 * omitting `m1Fit` does NOT fall back to the audited model, it silently
 * switches the tip to COLD-START logits (`m1Source: 'manual'`). Likewise a
 * missing `ensembleWM1` reverts to the constant default instead of the tuned
 * weight, and a missing `dixonColesRho` reverts to independent Poisson. In all
 * three cases the tip and the accuracy measured on the Audit screen describe
 * DIFFERENT models. A dev-mode warning is emitted for the `m1Fit` case so the
 * regression cannot happen quietly again.
